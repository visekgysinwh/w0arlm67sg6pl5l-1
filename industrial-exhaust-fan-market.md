<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Exhaust Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial exhaust fan market consists of three main types: centrifugal fans, axial fans, and others. Centrifugal fans use a rotating element to draw air in and exhaust it at a right angle, making them ideal for high-pressure applications. Axial fans move air parallel to the fan shaft, providing high airflow with lower pressure, suitable for general ventilation. "Others" encompasses specialized fan types, such as mixed-flow fans and positive displacement fans, which cater to specific industrial needs and environments.</p></p>
